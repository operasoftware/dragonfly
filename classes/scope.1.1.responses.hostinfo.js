    * This field contains the major and minor version number of the service.
    * The first number is the major version, the second is the minor, and any additional
    * numbers/strings are not of relevance but can be shown to the end-user if wanted.
    * 
    * The major version determines major changes (ie. compatibility breaks), while
    * the minor version determines incremental changes (ie. backwards compatible).
    * The client must check these two numbers to ensure it is able to communicate
    * properly with the service. If the major version is different from the
    * versions the client is compatible with, or the minor version is less than
    * the required version, it must disconnect.
    * 
    * Let us say a client supports version 1.6 and up and also version 2.0 and up.
    * It would do::
    * 
    *   if major == 1 and minor >= 6 or major == 2:
    *     print "We support service version %d.%d" % (major, minor)
    *   else:
    *     print "We do not support service version %d.%d" % (major, minor)
