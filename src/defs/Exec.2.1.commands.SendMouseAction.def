    * `buttonAction` specifies the buttons to press or release
    * It is specifies as the sum of button actions:
    *       1 - Button 1 down
    *       2 - Button 1 up
    * 
    *       4 - Button 2 down
    *       8 - Button 2 up
    * 
    *      16 - Button 3 down
    *      32 - Button 3 up
    * 
    * For example, to press button 1 and release button 2, the value is 9 (1+8)
    * 
    * Buttons are clicked in the sequence listed above. Note that down actions are
    * listed before up actions, thus allowing single-clicking with one command
    * (e.g. using value 3)
