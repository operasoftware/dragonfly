    * Set this field to match rules with the specified pseudo selectors, even
    * if that rule is not currently applied.
    * 
    * The rule will match if either of the specified pseudo classes or pseudo
    * elements are used in the selector. Order does not matter.
    * 
    * This is handy for inspecting and modifying style rules for non-current
    * element states.
    * 
    * LINK and VISISTED are not supported for elements that are not links.
    * 
    * Using this field will not alter the state of the element. Selecting
    * HOVER, for instance, when an element is currently not hovered will
    * therefore not *apply* the HOVER style rules.
