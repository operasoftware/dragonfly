   * Set this field to match rules with the specified pseudo selectors, even
   * if that rule is not currently applied.
   * 
   * The rule will match if either of the specified pseudo classes or pseudo
   * elements are used in the selector. Order does not matter.
   * 
   * This is handy for inspecting and modifying style rules for non-current
   * element states.
   * 
   * LINK and VISISTED are not supported for elements that are not links.
   * 
   * Using this field will not alter the state of the element. Selecting
   * HOVER, for instance, when an element is currently not hovered will
   * therefore not *apply* the HOVER style rules.
