      * This field contains the major and minor version number of the service.
      * The first number is the major version, the second is the minor, and any additional
      * numbers/strings are not of relevance but can be shown to the end-user if wanted.
      * 
      * The major version determines major changes (ie. compatibility breaks), while
      * the minor version determines incremental changes (ie. backwards compatible).
      * The client must check these two numbers to ensure it is able to communicate
      * properly with the service. If the major version is different from the
      * versions the client is compatible with, or the minor version is less than
      * the required version, it must disconnect.
      * 
      * Let us say a client supports version 1.6 and up and also version 2.0 and up.
      * It would do::
      * 
      *   if major == 1 and minor >= 6 or major == 2:
      *     print "We support service version %d.%d" % (major, minor)
      *   else:
      *     print "We do not support service version %d.%d" % (major, minor)
