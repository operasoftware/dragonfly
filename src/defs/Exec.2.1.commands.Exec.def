     * This is either a regular Opera action (e.g. "Page Down"),
     * or a special exec-action. Both kinds can be found by 
     * calling `GetActionInfoList`. The special cases are
     * prefixed with underscore ("_"), and these require `value` 
     * parameter to work, but always ignores `windowID`.
     * 
     * The special cases may include:
     *     _keydown | _keyup: 
     *         The `value` is either a key-name ("ctrl", "down", etc.)
     *         or a single character ("a", "b", etc.)
     *     _type: 
     *         Types the text present in `value` 
     *         (a different approach is the "Insert" action)
     * 
     * It is currently not possible to figure out which actions 
     * take parameters (`value`), and which don't. Optimistically, 
     * we have made the `Action` type extendable to include 
     * such information later.
