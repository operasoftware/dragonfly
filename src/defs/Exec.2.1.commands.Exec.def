      * The name of the action to execute. 
      * This is either a regular Opera action (e.g. "Page Down"),
      * or a special exec-action. Both kinds can be found by 
      * calling `GetActionInfoList`. The special cases are
      * prefixed with underscore ("_"), and these require `value` 
      * parameter to work, but always ignores `windowID`.
      * 
      * The special cases may include:
      *     _keydown | _keyup: 
      *         The `value` is either a key-name ("ctrl", "down", etc.)
      *         or a single character ("a", "b", etc.)
      *     _type: 
      *         Types the text present in `value` 
      *         (a different approach is the "Insert" action)
      * 
      * It is currently not possible to figure out which actions 
      * take parameters (`value`), and which don't. Optimistically, 
      * we have made the `Action` type extendable to include 
      * such information later.
