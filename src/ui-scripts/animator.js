/**
 * @constructor
 * @argument target {Object} animation definition dictionary

 * @class
 *
 * <div class="sidenote">Note: the classname "Animator" is a bit of a misnomer. It's more of a
 * three-state-button-o-matic. Might be renamed at a later date (runeh)</div>
 *
 * Handle a two or three state button with support for animaton. The button
 * has an initial state, an active state (possibly animated), and optionally
 * a final state. An example is a "connect" button. It starts out passive.
 * When pressed it animates a progress indicator, and when connected, it turns
 * green.
 *
 * The initial state is always the first in the image, that is, positioned
 * at 0px from the top. Hence, one does not need to pass an argument to
 * the constructor to set up the initial state.
 *
 * The animation is configured by passing a dictionary with settings. The
 * dictionary contains the following:
 *
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>id (required)<dd>The id of the element to operate as a string
 *  <dt>delta (required)<dd>The height of a frame of animation in pixels as an int
 *  <dt>iterations (required)<dd>The number of frames in the active state as in int
 *  <dt>active (optional)<dd>The offset of the first active state frame in the image in pixels as an int. Default: 0
 *  <dt>final (optional)<dd>The offset of the final state frame in the image in pixels as an int. Default: 0
 *  <dt>x_position (optional)<dd>The vertial offset of the strip of frames in the image in pixels as an int. Default: 0px
 *  <dt>time_delta (optional)<dd>The time between each frame in ms as an int. FPS is then equal to 1000/time_delta. Default: 30ms
 * </dl>
